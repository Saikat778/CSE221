#task 4i

# If there are N places and M roads, the time complexities of the solutions provided in problem 1 & problem 2 are O(MlogN).
# It takes O(|V|) time to construct the initial priority queue of |V| vertices. Then iterating over all verticesâ€™ neighbors
# and updating their cost values over the course of a run of the algorithm takes O(|E|) time.  for each iteration of the 
# loop time taken is O(|V|) as one vertex is removed from Q per loop.Then to extract-min distance nodes and update an 
# element it takes O(log|V|) time.

# The total time is O(M*logN)

#task 4ii

# If the number of titans in each road is exactly 1, we can use BFS to solve this problem.
# For the input file we need to add the destination node and we can remove the wieght of the path since it's 1 for all
# the paths.
